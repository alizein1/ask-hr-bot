Our people are our most valuable asset. We count on you to act responsibly; report concerns courageously, and model the integrity that defines who we are. From preventing corruption and protecting data, to respecting diversity and holding our partners to our values, This Code exists to guide us.
Ethical leadership begins at the top but must live at every level of the organization. Let this document serve as more than a policy, it is our shared promise to each other and to the communities we serve.
Thank you for your unwavering commitment to integrity. It is the cornerstone of our continued success.

2. Our Values and Leadership Commitments.
Introduction:
Our values are the compass that guides us how we conduct business at Capital Partners Group. They are not abstract concepts; they are the essence of who we are and what we expect from ourselves and one another. These values are Quality, Credibility, Growth, Commitment, Accountability, Professionalism and Integrity. These values are foundational to building trust with our stakeholders and delivering long-term success across Tawfeer, Euroland, Pro Logistics and all other subsidiaries. 
Rationale:
Strong ethical leadership starts with clear, lived values. Embedding these values across our organization ensures that our decisions, behavior, and strategies are consistent with our vision. Leaders at all levels are expected to lead by example and create a culture where ethical behavior is recognized, supported, and rewarded. This section reinforces the importance of living our values, especially in times of challenge or uncertainty.
Key Expectations:
Our values come to life through action. The expectations below are designed to guide everyone, regardless of position or responsibility, in demonstrating these values every day. They connect the principles outlined in the introduction and rationale to the practical, observable behaviors that sustain our ethical culture and define how leadership is exercised across Capital Partners Group.
All employees must integrate CPG's values into daily decisions, relationships, and business practices.
Everyone is expected to treat colleagues, partners, and customers with fairness, dignity, and respect.
Leaders and managers are accountable for:
Demonstrating ethical leadership and modeling expected behaviors.
Communicating the importance of our values and ethical standards.
Fostering a culture of openness, inclusivity, and continuous improvement.
Addressing misconduct consistently and without bias.
Supporting teams in applying our values to real-world situations.
Leaders must ensure the Code is accessible, understood, and regularly discussed within teams.
Values are not optional; they are essential criteria for performance evaluation and leadership advancement.
At Capital Partners Group, how we achieve results is just as important as the results themselves. We rely on our shared values to build a workplace we are proud of and a legacy we stand behind.
3. Making Ethical Decisions and Speaking Up.
Introduction:
Ethical decision-making is essential to maintaining the integrity, trust, and reputation of Capital Partners Group. Every day, employees across our businesses make choices that shape how we are perceived by our customers, partners, and communities. This section provides guidance to ensure that these decisions reflect our values and reinforce our commitment to doing the right thing.
Rationale:
Ethical situations are not always clear-cut. By providing a consistent framework, we empower employees to navigate uncertainty with confidence. When individuals are encouraged to speak up and are supported in doing so, we build a resilient, transparent, and accountable culture. At CPG, we believe that raising concerns is a sign of strength, not disloyalty.
Key Expectations:
The expectations below provide clear direction on how to make ethical decisions and raise concerns. They are designed to help all CPG employees recognize and respond to ethical challenges appropriately, and to ensure that every concern is treated seriously and without retaliation.
Use ethical judgment in all situations. Ask yourself:
Is it legal? Does it align with CPG’s values and Code?
Would I be comfortable if this appeared in the news? How would this decision affect others?
When in doubt, seek guidance from your manager, HR, or the Ethics Hotline before taking action.
Speak up if you witness misconduct or suspect unethical behavior. Silence allows issues to persist or worsen.
Multiple reporting channels are available, including:
Direct managers or supervisors
Human Resources
Legal team
Anonymous reporting via the Ethics Hotline or digital platform
Managers have a responsibility to:
Promote a safe environment for employees to speak up
Address reported concerns promptly and seriously
Escalate issues when necessary
Never retaliate against individuals who report in good faith
CPG strictly prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises concern, participates in an investigation, or refuses to engage in unethical conduct.
All Reports will be handled with confidentiality and professionalism and will be investigated objectively.
All employees are expected to cooperate fully in any investigation and respect the sensitive nature of the process.
By making sound ethical decisions and encouraging open dialogue, we create a stronger, more resilient organization, one where integrity is everyone’s responsibility.
4. Zero Tolerance for Corruption, Bribery & Gifts.
Introduction:
Capital Partners Group is firmly committed to conducting business with integrity, transparency, and fairness. We do not tolerate bribery, corruption, or unethical exchanges in any form. Whether dealing with public officials, suppliers, clients, or other stakeholders, all employees and business partners must act in a way that reflects our commitment to ethical business practices.
Rationale:
Corruption and bribery erode trust, distort decision-making, and expose individuals and organizations to legal, financial, and reputational risks. This policy safeguards CPG from these threats by providing clear rules that uphold fairness in our operations and maintain public confidence in our business conduct.
Key Expectations:
The expectations outlined below make clear what is acceptable and what is not in the context of gifts, entertainment, and financial or non-financial incentives. They serve to protect individuals from ethical missteps and preserve the Group’s integrity across all markets and functions.
Offering, soliciting, or accepting bribes or kickbacks is strictly prohibited in any form, including cash, services, favors, or anything of value.
Employees must never request personal benefits from customers, vendors, or other external stakeholders.

All employees are responsible for understanding and complying with anti-bribery laws applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate, including international laws where relevant.
At Capital Partners Group, there is no room for ambiguity when it comes to ethical conduct. Bribery and corruption are not just violations of our Code; they are violations of trust. Everyone has a role to play in preventing misconduct and upholding our reputation as a fair, law-abiding business.
5. Conflicts of Interest.
Introduction:
At Capital Partners Group, we recognize that employees may have personal interests outside of work. However, it is critical that these interests do not conflict, or appear to conflict, with the responsibilities and decisions we make on behalf of the Group. A conflict of interest undermines trust and may compromise the integrity of our operations, even if unintentional.
Rationale:
Conflicts of interest can arise in many ways: personal relationships, financial interests, external employment, or dealings with suppliers and competitors. Left undisclosed, they can damage credibility, skew decision-making, and raise legal or ethical concerns. Transparency ensures we protect the Group’s reputation and maintain fair, objective business practices.
Key Expectations:
This section sets out expectations for identifying, disclosing, and managing potential conflicts of interest. All CPG employees must act in the company’s best interests and avoid situations that could compromise or appear to compromise their impartiality.
Employees must avoid situations where personal interests’ conflict with professional duties.
Common examples of potential conflicts include:
Holding a financial interest in a competitor, supplier, or customer.
Close relationships with vendors or partners you influence or supervise.
Engaging in outside employment or consulting that overlaps with your role at CPG.
Hiring, supervising, or awarding contracts to family members or close friends.
All actual, perceived, or potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed:
Notify your manager or HR immediately.
Use designated conflict of interest disclosure forms where required.
Managers are responsible for reviewing disclosures and ensuring appropriate mitigation actions are taken.
Employees must not use company information or position for personal gain, nor should they compete with CPG in any way.

Failure to disclose a conflict of interest may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination as per respective Labor Laws.
Capital Partners Group depends on transparency and accountability to preserve its integrity. Disclosing a conflict of interest is not a violation, it’s the right step toward protecting your reputation and the trust others place in our organization.

Introduction:
Capital Partners Group places the highest priority on the security and confidentiality of personal, employee, customer, and corporate information. With the increasing reliance on digital data and communication, every team member has a role to play in protecting sensitive information and using it responsibly. 
Rationale:

Employees must feel empowered to speak up about unethical, illegal, or unsafe behavior without fear of retaliation.

Rationale:
Whistleblower protection is essential to creating an open, responsible workplace. When employees raise concerns in good faith, they help protect our business, our people, and our values.

At Capital Partners Group, our ethical standards are more than words, they are promises backed by action. Adherence to these standards is not optional, and enforcement is essential to preserving our integrity and performance.
